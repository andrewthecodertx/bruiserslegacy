        The Story Behind Bruiser’s Legacy</h3>
      <p class="font-light font-[Inter] mt-4">
        Bruiser was more than a pet—he was a protector, a friend, and an
        inspiration. His unconditional love and resilience led us to create a
        rescue that would continue his mission. Today, we honor Bruiser by
        saving lives, one dog at a time.
